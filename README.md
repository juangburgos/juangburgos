### Hola Hello Bonjour ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juan, I am from Mexico but have been living in Europe for more than 10 years.

I am a control engineer who develops software when nobody looks. 

My main tools are:

* For control engineering: Matlab/Simulink.
* For software development: Qt and C++.

I mainly work on critial [industrial environments](https://github.com/juangburgos/QUaServer), but I am also keen on [web technologies](https://github.com/pidtuner/pidtuner.github.io).
